  - cita: “This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up
      sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how
      you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it
      anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through
      everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember,
      sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come
      and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much
      all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if
      you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who
      makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't
      mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always,
      always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So
      keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling,
      because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”

  - cita: “You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may
      love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you
      aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can
      make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making
      mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking
      about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that
      she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't
      analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy,
      let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.”
